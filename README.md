### Github API Data Collector

The application captures data from the Github API & presents it to the user. The data captured includes user profile & repository data. The repository data can be sorted & filtered in the table, & some statistics are presented.

The API is currently using Teddy Waweru's API token, set to expire on 20th August 2022.

The application requires for a valid username to be entered in order to display their information. Regardless, the application is pre-populated with some user profiles obtained from the Github API.
