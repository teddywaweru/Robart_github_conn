### Github API Data Collector

This application is intended as a Test Proect submission for application at Robart GmbH.

This application captures data from the Github API & presents it to the user. The data captured includes:
- User profile details
- User repositories' details

The repository data can be sorted & filtered in the table, & some statistics are presented.

The API is currently using Teddy Waweru's API token, set to expire on 25th August 2022.

The application requires for a valid username to be entered in order to display their information. Regardless, the application is pre-populated with some user profiles obtained from the Github API.
